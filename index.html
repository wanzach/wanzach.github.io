            <h2> Brief Information about the Golden State Warriors </h2> 
            <p>The Golden State Warriors are an American professional basketball team based in Oakland, California. 
          The Warriors compete in the NBA as a team that plays in the Western Conference Division. 
          The team was established in 1946 as the Philadelphia Warriors based in Philadelphia, 
          Pennsylvania, a founding member of the Basketball Association of America (BAA). Their starting 5 
          players who start are Stephen Curry as Point Guard, Klay Thompson as Shooting Guard, Kevin Durant as Small Forward, 
          Draymond Green as Power Forward and Zaza Pachulia as Center. These players are the 2017 season roster. 
          In the 2015-16 season, they won the NBA Championship and it was a very historical moment. Unfourtunately, 
          two of their strong starting players left and both joined the Dallas Mavericks (Center Andrew Bogut and 
          Small Forward Harrison Barnes). Though in exchange, they recieved another all-star player coming from the Oklahoma 
          City Thunder, starting Small Forward Kevin Durant. They also recieved Center from the Dallas Mavericks Zaza Pachulia.</p>
